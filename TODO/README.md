### TODO

#### Testing
- @types/jest
- jest
- puppeteer
Install the above for testing / to implement testing.
```
npm install @types/jest jest puppeteer -D
```
Also put jsconfig into the main folder. It's to allow typechecking/linting with jest in all files in vscode.  
#### NOTE
Puppeteer is huge as it includes the Chromium/Chrome (don't remember which..) browser along in its installation
